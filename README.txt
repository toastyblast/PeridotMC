Peridot ore mod for Minecraft 1.12.2
Made by Toastyblast

This mod is my first step into learning minecraft modding using Java. I started this to freshen up my skills with the language.
I thought Minecraft would be a perfect fit for this, as I could see tangible results within the game, with the eventual goal that others too can see my creation.

This mod aims to add the following:
- Peridot gems, an ore found like diamonds or emeralds in the base game;
- Peridot "ore" blocks, of which clusters spawn within the Minecraft world;
- Peridot armor, which will have influences design-wise from Steven Universe's Peridot;
- A set of peridot tools;
- A peridot block.

This mod is not intended to be of any actual "use" or that outstanding within the modding scene.
I simply desire to make a workable basis for my first mod that is relatively simple, to learn the basis of the tools Forge allows me to use.

Furthermore, some things I would like to add, but are currently outside of my scope:
- Adding peridot to trades for villagers;
- Allowing peridot to be used for beacon pyramids;
- Creating a mob that could spawn around peridot clusters.

All textures made for this mod were made by me, using Krita.
This mod uses the Forge MDK for Minecraft 1.12.2 and requires this version of forge to run.

I made this mod while following the tutorials made by Cubicoder, found at https://cubicoder.github.io/ thus code may resemble their examples, as I haven't made mods before.
